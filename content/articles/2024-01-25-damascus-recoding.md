The proposed **Strategy for Sustainable Development** for the Republic of San Marino seeks to address the country’s challenges and needs in a comprehensive and systematic manner. The principal priorities of the proposed solution were as follows:  

- To establish a framework for structured data collection, analysis, and management.  
- To organise interventions in a holistic strategy, which recognises the complexities and interconnections between different systems.  
- To set measurable targets for each of the strategy’s goals and themes and to propose a methodology for evaluating the current state and potential interventions in relationship to these targets.  
- To provide a platform to empower local stakeholders and coordinate their efforts towards achieving the sustainability goals outlined in the strategy.  

With the motto **‘Revitalise and Connect’**, the proposed strategy for sustainable development seeks to establish three specific overarching goals for each of the three relevant scales, intended to guide and structure efforts towards sustainable development in the Republic of San Marino in the future:  

### Town Scale: Vibrant Towns  
San Marino’s *castelli* are the historic, social, and economic heart of the republic. This strategy seeks to chart a path towards achieving the Republic of San Marino’s environmental, social, and economic aspirations by revitalising its historic towns. Guided by the principles of **15-minute cities** and the **Cittaslow movement**, the strategy envisions the 12 urban cores, identified in this research as self-sufficient hubs, where all essential amenities and services required for daily life are accessible within each town centre. Additionally, it aims to enhance connectivity to these centres, providing accessibility for all residents.  

### National Scale: Well-Connected Network  
Historically, San Marino’s *castelli* have been united within a single republic since the Middle Ages, with each town playing a role in the state’s economic, social, and political life. The strategy proposes measures to further strengthen this system of towns by improving their connectivity and stimulating greater exchange between them.  

### International Scale: International Attractor  
As a landlocked microstate, San Marino is highly dependent on its international relations. The strategy envisions the republic as a regional leader, well-connected to Italy and the wider world, attracting international tourists, students, and professionals.  

## Strategic Framework  
To provide a systematic path to achieving the goals set on each of the three scales, the strategy is structured with a detailed **Strategic Framework**, comprising **32 measurable targets**, which could serve as key performance indicators (KPIs) tracking the progress of the strategy’s implementation. These targets are grouped into five themes, based on the strategy’s ambitions:  

1. **Mobility**  
2. **Environment**  
3. **Urban Planning & Development**  
4. **Culture & Heritage**  
5. **Social & Economic Activity**  

While some of the targets are selected following global trends in sustainable urban planning and development, using universally applicable standards and benchmarks, others are specifically tailored to the unique context of San Marino. The strategic framework, including targets, benchmarks, and measurement methodology, is presented in the following table:

## Evaluation

The Strategic Framework was used to perform an evaluation of the current state for all listed targets and all urban centres (for Town Scale targets). The sources of data for the evaluation were the following:

* Open-source map data (OpenStreetMap; Google Maps)
* High-definition satellite imagery (provided by the Ministry of Territory, Environment, Agriculture and Civil Protection of the Republic of San Marino)
* San Marino General Plan (provided by the Ministry of Territory, Environment, Agriculture and Civil Protection of the Republic of San Marino)
* Census data (Office of Informatics, Technology, Data and Statistics of the Republic of San Marino)
* Manually sourced data

Catchment and buffer areas were generated using QGIS software, which was also used to organise and process all geo-spatial data. The measurement methodology, described in the Strategic Framework was applied to calculate percentage scores for each town's performance (for Town Scale targets) against each benchmark. These calculations were performed in Grasshopper programming language in Rhinoceros 3D software. These scores were then grouped by themes to generate a simplified country-wide evaluation of the 12 town centres' performance, which is presented in the following map.

This evaluation shows how closely each town aligns with the benchmarks established in the framework, enabling comparisons of strengths and weaknesses between towns. Additionally, it may serve to guide strategic interventions and community efforts by providing valuable insights to inform decision-makers and stakeholders. The Strategic Framework can further be utilised to quantify the specific needs of each town and to assess the impact of potential interventions across the territory in relation to the goals outlined in the Strategy for Sustainable Development.

In this manner, the proposed Strategic Framework can function as a practical, data-driven guide that translates the republic's overarching sustainability ambitions into clear and actionable steps at every scale and across all aspects of the country's urban development efforts.

## Decision-Support Tool

To offer practical guidance and organise the efforts of various stakeholders in achieving the goals outlined in the Strategy for Sustainable Development, a prototype Decision-Support Tool was developed.

This online digital tool integrates the entire Strategic Framework and offers an accessible and user-friendly interface. It serves as a resource for the government and other stakeholders, including local communities, architects, developers, and university students, providing insights into their town's performance strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, it quantifies the needs of each town and scale of action required to meet the Strategic Framework's benchmarks, presenting this information in a clear and intuitive manner.

The tool's interactive Builder Mode allows users to evaluate potential interventions at any location across the territory and to assess their impact on the performance of San Marino's towns relative to the benchmarks established in the Strategic Framework. This functionality supports informed decision-making and data-driven strategic planning, helping to organise community efforts toward achieving the strategic goals outlined in this project.

All data incorporated into the tool is displayed on an interactive map, offering an intuitive visual representation of the Strategic Framework's benchmarks and measurement methodology for each target. The side panels provide additional information on the framework's goals and targets and provide links to relevant resources.
