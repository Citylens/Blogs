# Strategy for Sustainable Development for the Republic of San Marino  

The proposed **Strategy for Sustainable Development** for the Republic of San Marino seeks to address the country’s challenges and needs in a comprehensive and systematic manner. The principal priorities of the proposed solution were as follows:  

- To establish a framework for structured data collection, analysis, and management.  
- To organise interventions in a holistic strategy, which recognises the complexities and interconnections between different systems.  
- To set measurable targets for each of the strategy’s goals and themes and to propose a methodology for evaluating the current state and potential interventions in relationship to these targets.  
- To provide a platform to empower local stakeholders and coordinate their efforts towards achieving the sustainability goals outlined in the strategy.  

With the motto **‘Revitalise and Connect’**, the proposed strategy for sustainable development seeks to establish three specific overarching goals for each of the three relevant scales, intended to guide and structure efforts towards sustainable development in the Republic of San Marino in the future:  

### Town Scale: Vibrant Towns  
San Marino’s *castelli* are the historic, social, and economic heart of the republic. This strategy seeks to chart a path towards achieving the Republic of San Marino’s environmental, social, and economic aspirations by revitalising its historic towns. Guided by the principles of **15-minute cities** and the **Cittaslow movement**, the strategy envisions the 12 urban cores, identified in this research as self-sufficient hubs, where all essential amenities and services required for daily life are accessible within each town centre. Additionally, it aims to enhance connectivity to these centres, providing accessibility for all residents.  

### National Scale: Well-Connected Network  
Historically, San Marino’s *castelli* have been united within a single republic since the Middle Ages, with each town playing a role in the state’s economic, social, and political life. The strategy proposes measures to further strengthen this system of towns by improving their connectivity and stimulating greater exchange between them.  

### International Scale: International Attractor  
As a landlocked microstate, San Marino is highly dependent on its international relations. The strategy envisions the republic as a regional leader, well-connected to Italy and the wider world, attracting international tourists, students, and professionals.  

## Strategic Framework  
To provide a systematic path to achieving the goals set on each of the three scales, the strategy is structured with a detailed **Strategic Framework**, comprising **32 measurable targets**, which could serve as key performance indicators (KPIs) tracking the progress of the strategy’s implementation. These targets are grouped into five themes, based on the strategy’s ambitions:  

1. **Mobility**  
2. **Environment**  
3. **Urban Planning & Development**  
4. **Culture & Heritage**  
5. **Social & Economic Activity**  

While some of the targets are selected following global trends in sustainable urban planning and development, using universally applicable standards and benchmarks, others are specifically tailored to the unique context of San Marino. The strategic framework, including targets, benchmarks, and measurement methodology, is presented in the following table:
